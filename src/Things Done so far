the aim of this repo is to get familiar with the different hooks in the react

EOD: 17-10-22:
        i have made use of the hooks like usestate, useeffect(replicating didmount and didupdate) , usecontext(while sharing movie title from landingcomp to detailedview comp)

MRNG session : 19-10-22:
        i have added the playable video for each movie data retrived from the api.
        i have made use of hooks like useRef,ForwardRef,useimperativeHandle:
                        scenarios where i used three hooks are as follows:
                                        i have made whenever we click the playtrailer button of a movie then we can see the trailer
                                        but when i clicked the other movie from list( assuming already a trailer was placed) then details of current selected movie would rendered except the old movie trailer was in that place.
                                        thus new movie click is on landingpage component which encapsule the detailed view component thus i had to find a way to access the innercomponent's resetbackdrop function whenever a new movie is selected on the outer list component
                                        so i achieved it by the steps:
                                                        create a ref with ur name of choice in outer component (landingpage.js ->resetbackdropref)
                                                        then assign that ref to innercomponent(ref={resetbackdropref} in landingpage.js's line of detailedview component)
                                                        then in the inner component(detailedview) reframe the following that you gonna pass the ref to the inner component's resetbackdrop function thus use the forwardref to whole component wrap
                                                        then we have to send out the logic of resetbackdrop fn thus use the imperative handle to achieve the same
                                                        then in outer component i have placed the necessary innercomponent logic call by 'resetbackdropref.current.resetbackdrop()' call statement in handleclickontrendlist,handleclickonpopularlist
